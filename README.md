## Features Implemented

### Flexbox
- Horizontal navigation layout
- Equal-width column layout with reordering
- Centered card layout with tag styling

### CSS Grid

- Different timing durations for hover-in and hover-out states

## Notes
- All required styling changes were implemented in `styles.css` only.
- No modifications were made to `global.css`.
- Only the name field was edited in `index.html`, as instructed.
- The project structure was preserved to ensure proper loading of CSS and images.

## How to Run
1. Unzip the project folder.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
3. All styles and images should load automatically.
